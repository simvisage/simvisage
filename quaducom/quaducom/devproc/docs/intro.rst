Introduction
============

The package implements the algorithms
for the simulation of the oricrete structures.
It includes the simulation of the folding process
of crease patterns using kinematic model. Further, it 
provides the possibility to fix the structure 
at its final stage and simulate the load bearing behavior 
of the structure.
