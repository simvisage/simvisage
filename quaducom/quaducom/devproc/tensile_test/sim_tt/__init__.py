== Simulation of tensile tests ==

The module contains simulation classes for tensile tests.

 1. sim_tt_mdmia.py is used for the calibration of damage functions
    for the microplane damage model with initial anisotropy
 2. sim_tt_scm.py is used to model the response using 
    the stochastic cracking model.
